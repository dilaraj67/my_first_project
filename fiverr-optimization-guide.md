On Fiverr, you DON'T apply to jobs. Instead:
1. **Create Gigs** - Service listings that buyers purchase
2. **Respond to Buyer Requests** - Buyers post what they need, you send offers
3. **Get Found** - Buyers search and find your gigs

## EXAMPLES OF HOW TO USE ME

### Example 1: Create a Gig

**You say:**
"I can do data entry, Excel work, and web research. Help me create a gig for small business owners."

**I generate:**

- Full description with bullets

- Tags: data entry, excel, spreadsheet, virtual assistant, etc.

### Example 2: Respond to Buyer Request

**You paste:**
"Need someone to transcribe 30 minutes of audio. Budget $20. Need in 2 days."

**I generate:**
"Hi! I can transcribe your 30-minute audio with 99% accuracy within 24 hours. I have experience with [industry] content and will deliver a clean, formatted document. I can work within your $20 budget. Let's discuss the audio quality and any specific formatting you need. Ready to start immediately!"

### Example 3: Handle Difficult Message

**You paste:**
"Buyer is asking for revision but wants changes outside original scope"

**I generate:**
"Hi [Name], I'm happy to help! I've completed all items from the original order: [list them]. The changes you're requesting (X, Y, Z) are outside the original scope. I can absolutely do them - I can create a custom offer for $X which will take Y hours. Would you like me to send that over? Alternatively, if there are items from the original scope that need adjustment, I'm happy to revise those at no charge."
