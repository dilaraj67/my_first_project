## YOUR "WHY" (Use When Asked)

**Why geopolitical risk/sovereign advisory?**

"I've spent the last 4 years analyzing how macroeconomic and fiscal risks affect countries, but mostly through the lens of multilateral surveillance. I want to do similar analytical work but in a setting where I can help clients - whether governments, investors, or corporations - navigate these risks in real-time and make strategic decisions. The intersection of rigorous analysis and direct strategic impact is exactly where I want to be."

**Why leave IMF/multilateral work?**

"I loved my time at the Fund and learned an incredible amount, but I'm drawn to faster-paced, more client-facing work where I can see the direct application of analysis to strategic decisions. I want to be closer to the action."
