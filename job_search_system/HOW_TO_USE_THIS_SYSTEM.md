## 🤖 AUTOMATION WITH ME (CLAUDE)

Instead of doing everything manually, use me to speed things up:

### **Quick Message Generation**

**When you find someone interesting, paste this to me:**

```
PERSON:
Name: [Their name]
Company: [Company]
Title: [Their role]
Connection: [HKS alum / IMF alum / 1st degree / InMail / Senior]
Applied?: [Yes - role name / No]

COMMONALITIES:
- [e.g., Both worked at IMF]
- [e.g., They posted about sovereign debt]

NOTES:
[Anything specific - recent post, company news, etc.]
```

**I'll instantly generate a personalized message in YOUR voice.**

---

### **Batch Processing**

**Fill out multiple people in one go:**

1. Open **linkedin_outreach_queue.txt** (already in your system)
2. Fill out 5-10 people as you find them
3. Copy entire file
4. Paste to me
5. Say: "Generate messages for all of these"
6. I'll give you all messages at once

**This saves you 20-30 minutes.**

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"I'm not getting responses"**

**Check:**
- ❌ Are messages too generic? (Add more personalization)
- ❌ Are you messaging right connection types? (HKS/IMF alumni respond more)
- ❌ Are you sending at right times? (Tue-Thu, 9-11am best)
- ❌ Is your LinkedIn profile complete? (They check before responding)

**Fix:** Review **message_templates.md** and add MORE specific details about each person

---

### **"I don't know what to say"**

**Use the Emergency Template from quick_reference_guide.md:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Hope this note finds you well. I'm finishing my MPP at Harvard Kennedy School this May after 4 years at the IMF working on sovereign debt in the Middle East.

I came across your profile and [specific thing about them] really caught my attention. Would you have 15 minutes for a call sometime? I'd love to hear about your experience at [Company].

Many thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Just fill in the brackets and send. Don't overthink.**

---

### **"I'm getting overwhelmed"**

**Scale back to bare minimum:**
- Monday: 3 messages (15 min)
- Wednesday: 3 messages (15 min)
- Friday: Weekly review (10 min)

**Total: 40 min/week**

**Even at this pace, you're making progress.**

---

### **"They said yes to a call - what do I do?"**

**Immediately reply:**

```
That's great - thank you so much! I really appreciate you taking the time.

I'm fairly flexible - would any of these times work for you?
- [Day], [Date] at [Time]
- [Day], [Date] at [Time]
- [Day], [Date] at [Time]

Happy to do Zoom, phone, or whatever works best.

Looking forward to it!
```

**Then prep using questions from your_profile_summary.md**
