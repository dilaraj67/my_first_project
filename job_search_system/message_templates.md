Hi [First Name],

Hope this note finds you well. I'm finishing my MPP at the Kennedy School this May and came across your profile - saw you made the move from HKS to [Company].

Would you have 15 minutes for a call sometime? I'd love to hear about your experience at [Company] and what you wish you'd known when you were in my shoes at Kennedy School.

Totally understand if you're swamped - even a few thoughts over message would be helpful.

Many thanks,
