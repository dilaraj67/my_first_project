Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Global Macro Analyst position at Eurasia Group with a proven ability to synthesize macroeconomic data and political risk analysis, evidenced by my [Master's/PhD] research on [specific topic, e.g., "emerging market sovereign debt crises"] at [elite university] and my recent work as [relevant internship/role] at [organization]. My academic training in both economics and political science, combined with native fluency in [language] and [duration] spent living in [country/region], equips me to deliver the rigorous, interdisciplinary analysis that defines Eurasia Group's Global Macro platform.

My thesis, "[Title]," analyzed how [political variable] affects [economic outcome] across [number] countries, developing an econometric model that achieved [specific result/finding]. This research was presented at [conference] and has been cited by [publication/organization]. More importantly, it taught me to navigate the messy intersection of politics and markets where traditional economic models often fail—precisely the domain where Eurasia Group excels.

During my internship at [organization, e.g., investment firm/think tank/central bank], I contributed to [specific macro research project], where I was responsible for [specific tasks like building forecasting models, conducting scenario analysis, monitoring political developments]. I also independently published [number] briefings on [topics], demonstrating my ability to write clear, actionable analysis under deadline pressure. One of my reports on [specific event] was distributed to [senior stakeholders/clients] and informed [specific decision/outcome].

I bring the technical toolkit essential for modern macro analysis: proficiency in [statistical software like Python, R, Stata], experience with [specific methodologies like DSGE models, event studies, time-series analysis], and a systematic approach to monitoring markets and political developments. However, I also recognize that the most valuable insights come from understanding context—which is why I maintain regular conversations with [contacts in region], follow [specific local news sources], and have built a network of [relevant contacts like academics, former officials, journalists].

Eurasia Group's recent analysis of [specific current topic, e.g., "US-China decoupling" or "Latin American political cycles"] particularly resonated with my own research interests. I have been following your team's work on [specific theme], and I would be excited to contribute to expanding this research agenda. My background in [specific relevant area] would allow me to immediately add value to ongoing projects while developing my skills across other regions and themes.

I am attracted to Eurasia Group not only for its intellectual rigor but also for its commitment to speaking publicly about complex issues in accessible ways. As someone who has [presented research/taught/written for general audiences], I am eager to develop my voice as both a researcher and communicator.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my analytical capabilities, regional knowledge, and enthusiasm for global macro research can contribute to your team. I have attached my resume, writing sample, and salary expectations as requested.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
