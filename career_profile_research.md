- **Action verbs are analyst-specific**: Authored, Conducted, Monitored, Briefed, Coordinated, Drafted
- **Publications section exists even if small** — signals you produce original analysis, not just consume it
- **Technical skills are specific** — Stata/R/Python + domain-specific tools (Bloomberg, ACLED, UN Comtrade)
- **Languages front and center** — critical differentiator in geopolitical roles
- **Clearance line** — if you have one, this alone opens doors

### WHY THIS TEMPLATE WORKS:
- **"Profile" not "Objective"** — sounds like a professional brief, not a job application plea
- **Scenario planning + predictive accuracy** — these are the premium skills in geopolitical risk
- **Government experience framed in private-sector language** — "clients," "portfolio," "C-suite"
- **Structured Analytic Techniques explicitly named** — this is the currency of intelligence analysis
- **OSINT tools listed** — Palantir, Babel Street, Recorded Future signal you're not just a policy generalist
- **Affiliations section** — YPFP, Truman Project, WIIS = signals you're networked in the DC ecosystem
- **The "bridge" narrative** — government credibility → private sector monetization is the career arc employers want to see

## HOW TO USE THESE TEMPLATES

1. **Pick the template closest to your target role:**
   - Template 1 → Think tanks, Treasury/State, sanctions/trade policy shops, CFR/Brookings
   - Template 2 → Corporate geopolitical risk (Eurasia Group, Google, McKinsey), intelligence community, defense consultancies

2. **Fill in YOUR content but keep the structure and density** — every bullet needs a number or a concrete deliverable

3. **Minimum bar for each bullet:**
   - Action verb + what you did + scale/scope + outcome/impact
   - BAD: "Assisted with research on China policy"
   - GOOD: "Authored 8 analytical briefs on China's industrial subsidy regime, directly cited in senior fellow's Foreign Affairs article"

4. **If you lack experience in a section, substitute with:**
   - Coursework projects framed as deliverables ("Developed econometric model assessing...")
   - Capstone/thesis framed as a publication
   - Class simulations framed as "scenario planning exercises"
