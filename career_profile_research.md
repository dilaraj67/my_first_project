### Career Trajectory
1. **Central Intelligence Agency (22 years, 1997–~2019)** — Joined as political-military analyst; rose to Senior Intelligence Service (SIS, equivalent to general officer rank)
   - Deputy Associate Director of CIA for Korea Mission Center
   - Chief of Korea Department

- PDB briefer = literally briefed the President of the United States on geopolitical intelligence
- Seamless transition from government intelligence to **corporate geopolitical risk at Google**

- **The gold standard for intelligence-to-private-sector transition**
- Only a B.A. in History — proves that trajectory and performance matter more than degrees
- PDB briefer credential is virtually unmatched in prestige for intelligence analysis
- Google Director title + global scope shows this expertise commands top-tier corporate roles
- The combination of CIA Deputy Associate Director + Google Director + CFR + CSIS fellow is the pinnacle of the geopolitics-meets-economics career path

## KEY PATTERNS ACROSS BOTH PROFILES

### What they share:
1. **Government-to-private-sector pipeline** — Both built credibility in government before monetizing expertise in corporate strategy
2. **CSIS Strategy & Statecraft Fellowship** — Both were selected for this elite program
3. **Published/visible thought leadership** — Not just practitioners but recognized thinkers
4. **Cross-domain expertise** — Neither stayed in one lane; both bridged intelligence, policy, and business
5. **Regional depth + global breadth** — Deep expertise in specific regions (Africa, Korea) while operating globally
6. **Senior executive advisory** — Both positions involve distilling complex geopolitical intelligence for C-suite decision-making

### Resume architecture lessons:
- **Lead with impact, not job descriptions** — Both profiles emphasize what they delivered, not what they were responsible for
- **Stack credentials strategically** — Fellowships, publications, and affiliations create a "halo effect"
- **Show the narrative arc** — A clear thread from early career to current role (not random job-hopping)
- **Quantify scope** — "9 global offices," "22 years," "15+ years," "largest RPA base in Africa"
- **Bridge sectors** — The most valuable people in geoeconomics speak both government AND corporate language
